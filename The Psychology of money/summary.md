## Intro

The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel explores how people think about and handle money. It delves into the emotional and psychological factors that influence financial decisions, often more than logic or knowledge. The book offers insights on wealth, greed, and happiness, emphasizing that financial success is more about behavior than intelligence. Through various anecdotes and examples, Housel provides valuable lessons on managing money and understanding its role in our lives.

### Chapter 1 : No one is crazy 

Most people around the world use their money in a way that is not necessarily based on their intelligence or goals, but rather on their life experiences.

### Chapter  2 : Luck and risk aka <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">fate</mark> 
 
Fate controls our lives more than we think, and we don't take it into consideration. Here are three lessons:

1. Don't look at things from the front door (people, stories), but instead try to understand the backstory and how fate contributed to the event.

2. Try to look for regular cases instead of extreme ones because it's hard to replicate these cases due to fate.

3. The margin between being too bold and reckless is so thin that we can't even distinguish between them.

### Chapter 3 :Never enough

Many people, including myself, don't know when to stop and we take more and more risks doing things that probably aren't worth it.

1. Always set long-term goals to know when to stop.

2. Always ask yourself if it's worth the risk.

3. Stop comparing yourself to others because that will never end.

### Chapter 4: Compounding 

Many of us don't take into consideration the idea of compounding. Your actions over the years will accumulate into either good or bad outcomes.

1. Small things you do may seem unnecessary, but they're the core of what will come later.

2. Good investing is not really about having the highest returns, but more about being consistent in having good enough returns.

### Chapter 5: Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy

Getting wealthy is one thing, but staying wealthy requires a completely different set of skills.

1. First, you need to accept that taking small steps to reach your financial goals and allowing compounding to take effect are crucial.

2. Plan for every important move you make, while taking into consideration a margin of error which is the risk of things not working out as intended.

3. Be optimistic, but also acknowledge that you will face some challenges along the way.


### Chapter 6: Tails Of Failure 

We to be convinced that many of our experiments will fail and only a few will make a notable success.

1. Investing with huge quantities is one of good strategies we can follow.

2. Know that when a perfectly planned project will fail if something expected happens, so keep trying till the wind goes your way.


### Chapter 7: Money Pays You Time

The biggest advantage of been wealthy is the ability to control time. You can do what you want , when you want and how ever you want.

1. Money will pay you the time needed to do things like visiting a doctor , taking vacation with your family , finding new job without worrying.

2. The thing which make you happy the most in your life is not been controlled by the pursuit of money and having time to do what you want.

### Chapter 8: Wealth Does Not Bring Admiration

We often believe that having a lot of money will make people admire and respect us, but the harsh reality is that this is not true. People want what you have, not you.

1. Pursue wealth to live a good life, not to impress others.
  
2. You earn respect by helping others and showing empathy. 

### Chapter 9 & 10: Being Wealthy vs Being Rich

Being rich is about displaying your spending to others. Wealth, on the other hand, is hiddenâ€”it's about holding onto money without spending it until necessary.

1. Saving money is crucial; it's the key to building wealth.
   
2. To save money, you need to lower your wants. To lower your wants, you must stop caring about what others think.
