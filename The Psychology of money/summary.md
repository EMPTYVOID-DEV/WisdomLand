The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel explores how people think about and handle money. It delves into the emotional and psychological factors that influence financial decisions, often more than logic or knowledge. The book offers insights on wealth, greed, and happiness, emphasizing that financial success is more about behavior than intelligence. Through various anecdotes and examples, Housel provides valuable lessons on managing money and understanding its role in our lives.

### Chapitre 1 : No one is crazy 

Most people around the world use their money in a way that is not necessarily based on their intelligence or goals, but rather on their life experiences.

### Chapitre  2 : Luck and risk aka <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">fate</mark> 
 
Fate controls our lives more than we think, and we don't take it into consideration. Here are three lessons:

1. Don't look at things from the front door (people, stories), but instead try to understand the backstory and how fate contributed to the event.

2. Try to look for regular cases instead of extreme ones because it's hard to replicate these cases due to fate.

3. The margin between being too bold and reckless is so thin that we can't even distinguish between them.
