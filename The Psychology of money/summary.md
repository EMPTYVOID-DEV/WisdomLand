## Intro

The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel explores how people think about and handle money. It delves into the emotional and psychological factors that influence financial decisions, often more than logic or knowledge. The book offers insights on wealth, greed, and happiness, emphasizing that financial success is more about behavior than intelligence. Through various anecdotes and examples, Housel provides valuable lessons on managing money and understanding its role in our lives.

### Chapter 1 : No one is crazy 

Most people around the world use their money in a way that is not necessarily based on their intelligence or goals, but rather on their life experiences.

### Chapter  2 : Luck and risk aka <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">fate</mark> 
 
Fate controls our lives more than we think, and we don't take it into consideration. Here are three lessons:

1. Don't look at things from the front door (people, stories), but instead try to understand the backstory and how fate contributed to the event.

2. Try to look for regular cases instead of extreme ones because it's hard to replicate these cases due to fate.

3. The margin between being too bold and reckless is so thin that we can't even distinguish between them.

### Chapter 3 :Never enough

Many people, including myself, don't know when to stop and we take more and more risks doing things that probably aren't worth it.

1. Always set long-term goals to know when to stop.

2. Always ask yourself if it's worth the risk.

3. Stop comparing yourself to others because that will never end.


### Chapter 4: Compounding 

Many of us don't take into consideration the idea of compounding. Your actions over the years will accumulate into either good or bad outcomes.

1. Small things you do may seem unnecessary, but they're the core of what will come later.

2. Good investing is not really about having the highest returns, but more about being consistent in having good enough returns.
